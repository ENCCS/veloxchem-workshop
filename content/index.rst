VeloxChem: quantum chemistry from laptop to HPC
===============================================

Quantum molecular modeling of complex molecular systems is an indispensable and
integrated component in advanced material design, as such simulations provide a
microscopic insight into the underlying physical processes.
In this workshop, you will learn how to use the `VeloxChem program package <https://veloxchem.org/>`_ to:

- Perform quantum chemical simulations of *ground- and excited-state properties*
  of large systems.
- Leverage the *aggregate resources* of modern HPC clusters to efficiently
  tackle large molecular systems.
- Use the Python application programming interface (API) to prototype new
  methods.
- Design interactive computational teaching materials in Python.


.. prereq::

   Before attending this workshop, please make sure that you have the
   prerequisite software and hardware available.

   Day 1
       We will work within `Jupyter notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`_. We have
       set up this lesson such that it can be run entirely within your browser,
       using cloud infrastructure.
       You can also use your own computer, provided that it has the necessary
       tools installed. If that is not the case, please follow these
       :ref:`detailed instructions <setup>`.

   Day 2
       You will need access to a supercomputer.  Any questions on how to use a
       particular HPC resource should be directed to the appropriate support
       desk.  Please follow these :ref:`detailed instructions <compiling>` on
       how to set up the necessary software stack.

Who is the course for?
----------------------

This lesson is for researchers and students already familiar with quantum
chemistry that want to learn how to:

- Perform quantum chemical simulations of ground- and excited-state properties
  on large systems and with efficient use of HPC resources.
- Use an interactive, computationally-oriented approach to teaching quantum
  chemistry.

We assume that participants have:

- A sufficiently thorough prior knowledge of self-consistent field theory, at
  the level presented in the *Modern Quantum Chemistry* textbook by Szabo and
  Ostlund :cite:`Szabo1996-vl`.
- Worked previously with other quantum chemical software packages.
- Some familiarity with the Python programming language. :ref:`We have listed <see-also>` some online resources to refresh your Python knowledge.


About the course
----------------


This lesson material is developed by the `EuroCC National Competence Center
Sweden (ENCCS) <https://enccs.se/>`_ and the `PDC Center for High Performance Computing <https://www.pdc.kth.se/>`_.

Each lesson episode has clearly defined learning objectives and includes
exercises and solutions, and is therefore also useful for self-learning.
The lesson material is licensed under `CC-BY-4.0
<https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`_ and can be reused in any form
(with appropriate credit) in other courses and workshops.
Instructors who wish to teach this lesson can refer to the :doc:`guide` for
practical advice.

Interacting with the notebooks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`MyBinder <https://mybinder.org/>`_ offers a free, customizable cloud
computing environment and powers some of the contents of this lesson.
You can run the exercises for Day 1 of this workshop entirely in the
cloud.

The MyBinder web interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can access the JupyterLab instance for this workshop by clicking the "launch
binder" button at the top of the ``README`` file displayed at
https://github.com/ENCCS/veloxchem-workshop

.. figure:: img/launch_binder_button.png
   :scale: 70%
   :alt: Launching the binder
   :align: center

This will bring you to the loading page for the binder, which might
take a few minutes to start up. Don't despair!

.. figure:: img/binder_loading.png
   :scale: 50%
   :alt: The binder is loading
   :align: center

Once loaded, you will see the introductory notebook already open:

Accessing a terminal
++++++++++++++++++++

From the "Launcher" tab, you can access terminal, Python interpreter, and notebook launchers:

.. figure:: img/launcher_menu.png
   :scale: 50%
   :alt: Launcher menu on Jupyter Lab
   :align: center

You can open a text editor (for input files etc) by clicking "New" and
select Text File. If you prefer a terminal editor, you can use ``nano`` or
``vim`` or ``emacs``.

Starting the notebook from an episode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can run the notebook directly from an episode in the lesson. Click on the
rocket icon on the top right of the page and select which launcher to use:

.. figure:: img/launchers.png

   :alt: Launcher menu on Jupyter Lab
   :align: center

"Binder" will redirect you the binder instance. With "Live code", you can run
and modify the code cells within the webpage.
The "Live code" option is powered by `sphinx-thebe <https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-thebe>`_ and, behind the scenes,
MyBinder. Be aware that you will not be able to add new code cells in a live
session.
