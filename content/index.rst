Multiwavelet tutorial
=====================

In this tutorial you will learn how to use the multiresolution analysis tools of
the MRChem suite.

Using the `VAMPyR <https://github.com/MRChemSoft/vampyr/>`_ Python package you will learn:

- What a multiwavelet basis is and what it looks like.
- How to use multiresolution analysis to represent functions and operators in
  1D, 2D and 3D real space.
- How to use the Python application programming interface (API) to prototype a
  small chemistry application.

Using the `MRChem <https://github.com/MRChemSoft/mrchem/>`_ program you will learn:

- How to run ground-state SCF calculations to high numerical precision.
- How to run linear response calculations to obtain molecular properties like
  polarizability, magnetizability and NMR shielding tensors.
- How to run large scale calculations using thousands of CPU cores on HPC clusters.

.. prereq::

   Before attending this workshop, please make sure that you have the
   prerequisite software and hardware available.

   Exercise 1: Multiwavelets with VAMPyR
       We will work within `Jupyter notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`_. We have
       set up this lesson such that it can be run entirely within your browser,
       using cloud infrastructure. You can also use your own computer, provided
       that it has the necessary tools installed. If that is not the case, please
       follow these :ref:`detailed instructions <setup>`.

   Exercise 2: Molecular properties with MRChem
       We will work in a terminal environment using a traditional computational
       chemistry workflow: writing input files, running program, parsing output
       files. You *can* run this exercise in a terminal window in the provided
       browser environment, but in order to get full benefit you will need access
       to a supercomputer. Any questions on how to use a particular HPC resource
       should be directed to the appropriate support desk. Please follow these
       :ref:`detailed instructions <compiling>` on how to set up the necessary
       software stack.

Who is the course for?
----------------------

This lesson is for researchers and students that are already familiar with traditional
quantum chemistry methods using atom-centered basis functions like Gaussians,
that want to learn more about:

- What are multiresolution analysis (MRA) and multiwavelets?
- How can (and why should) MRA be applied to quantum chemical problems?
- How to use MRA to approach complete basis set limit molecular properties on real-world molecular systems.

We assume that participants have:

- A sufficiently thorough prior knowledge of self-consistent field theory, at
  the level presented in the *Modern Quantum Chemistry* textbook by Szabo and
  Ostlund :cite:`Szabo1996-vl`.
- Worked previously with other quantum chemical software packages.
- Some familiarity with the Python programming language. :ref:`We have listed <see-also>` some online resources to refresh your Python knowledge.


About the course
----------------


This lesson material is developed by the MRChem group at the `Hylleraas Center for Quantum
Molecular Sciences <https://www.mn.uio.no/hylleraas/english/>`_.

Each lesson episode has clearly defined learning objectives and includes
exercises and solutions, and is therefore also useful for self-learning.
The lesson material is licensed under `CC-BY-4.0
<https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`_ and can be reused in any form
(with appropriate credit) in other courses and workshops.

Interacting with the notebooks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`MyBinder <https://mybinder.org/>`_ offers a free, customizable cloud
computing environment and powers some of the contents of this lesson.
You can run the entirety of Exercise 1 and most of Exercise 2 of this
tutorial in the cloud.

The MyBinder web interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can access the JupyterLab instance for this workshop by clicking the "launch
binder" button at the top of the ``README`` file displayed at
https://github.com/MRChemSoft/multiwavelet-tutorial

.. figure:: img/launch_binder_button.png
   :scale: 70%
   :alt: Launching the binder
   :align: center

This will bring you to the loading page for the binder, which might
take a few minutes to start up. Once loaded you will end up in a
Jupyter-Lab environment with all necessary software packages installed.
Bevare that the cloud instance runs on limited computational resources,
so don't expect awesome performance. Also, launching full-fledged MRChem
calculations on molecules containing more than a few atoms is probably a
bad idea.

Accessing a terminal
++++++++++++++++++++

From the "Launcher" tab, you can access terminal, Python interpreter, and notebook launchers:

.. figure:: img/launcher_menu.png
   :scale: 50%
   :alt: Launcher menu on Jupyter Lab
   :align: center

You can open a text editor (for input files etc) by clicking "New" and
select Text File. If you prefer a terminal editor, you can use ``nano`` or
``vim`` or ``emacs``.

Starting the notebook from an episode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can run the notebook directly from an episode in the lesson. Click on the
rocket icon on the top right of the page and select which launcher to use:

.. figure:: img/launchers.png
   :scale: 50%
   :alt: Launcher menu on Jupyter Lab
   :align: center

"Binder" will redirect you the binder instance. With "Live code", you can run
and modify the code cells within the webpage.
The "Live code" option is powered by `sphinx-thebe <https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-thebe>`_ and, behind the scenes,
MyBinder. Be aware that you will not be able to add new code cells in a live
session.
