.. prereq::

   Before attending this workshop, please make sure that you have the
   prerequisite software and hardware available.

   Day 1
       We will work within `Jupyter notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`_. We have
       set up this lesson such that it can be run entirely within your browser,
       using cloud infrastructure.
       You can also use your own computer, provided that it has
       the necessary tools installed. If you do not already have these
       installed, we recommend that you set up an isolated software environment
       using ``conda``. Detailed instructions can be found
       on the :doc:`setup` page.

   Day 2
       Access to a supercomputer.
       Any questions on how to use a particular HPC resource should be directed
       to the appropriate support desk. Detailed instructions can be found
       on the :doc:`setup` page.

About the course
----------------


This lesson material is developed by the `EuroCC National Competence Center
Sweden (ENCCS) <https://enccs.se/>`_ and taught in ENCCS workshops.

It is aimed
at researchers and developers who might have had some exposure to `CMake`_ and
want to learn how to use it effectively. This lesson targets **CMake >=3.14**.

Each lesson episode has clearly defined learning objectives and includes
multiple exercises along with solutions, and is therefore also useful for
self-learning.
The lesson material is licensed under `CC-BY-4.0
<https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`_ and can be reused in any form
(with appropriate credit) in other courses and workshops.
Instructors who wish to teach this lesson can refer to the :doc:`guide` for
practical advice.

Interacting with the notebooks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`MyBinder <https://mybinder.org/>`_ offers a free, customizable cloud
computing environment and powers the content of this lesson.
You can run the exercises for Day 1 of this workshop entirely in the
cloud.

The MyBinder web interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can access the JupyterLab instance for this workshop by clicking the "launch
binder" button at the top of the ``README`` file displayed at
https://github.com/ENCCS/veloxchem-workshop

.. figure:: img/launch_binder_button.png
   :scale: 70%
   :alt: Launching the binder
   :align: center

This will bring you to the loading page for the binder, which might
take a few minutes to start up. Don't despair!

.. figure:: img/binder_loading.png

   :align: center

Once loaded, you will see the introductory notebook already open:

Accessing a terminal
++++++++++++++++++++

From the "Launcher" tab, you can access terminal, Python interpreter, and notebook launchers:

   :align: center

You can open a text editor (for input files etc) by clicking "New" and
select Text File. If you prefer a terminal editor, you can use ``nano`` or
``vim`` or ``emacs``.

Starting the notebook from an episode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can run the notebook directly from an episode in the lesson. Click on the
rocket icon on the top right of the page and select which launcher to use:

"Binder" will redirect you the binder instance. With "Live code", you can run
and modify the code cells within the webpage.
The "Live code" option is powered by `sphinx-thebe <https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-thebe>`_ and, behind the scenes,
MyBinder. Be aware that you will not be able to add new code cells in a live
session.
